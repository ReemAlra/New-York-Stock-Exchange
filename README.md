# New-York-Stock-Exchange
This project was part of the business analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.
# Introduction
In this project, I will analyze real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle(opens in a new tab) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.
# For this project, there are three Tasks:
- Complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings.
- Develop a Profit and Loss Statement dashboard.
- Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
